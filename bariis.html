    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <p>
      Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Make the xawaash: In a medium bowl,
      combine the cumin, coriander, turmeric, cardamom, black pepper, cloves,
      and nutmeg. Set aside. Heat a medium oven-safe pan over medium-high heat.
      Add the vegetable oil, onion, tomato, garlic, and cinnamon stick. Cook
      until the onions have softened slightly, 5-6 minutes. Season with salt,
      then add the vegetable stock cube and cilantro. Cook for 1 minute,
      breaking up the stock cube. Reduce the heat to medium, then stir in the
      xawaash and soaked rice. Cook for about 3 minutes so rice grains lightly
      toast. Pour in the hot water and increase the heat to high to bring to a
      boil. Cover the pot, transfer to the oven, and bake for 20 minutes. Check
      periodically to be sure the rice has enough water. Remove the cooked rice
      from the oven and drizzle the red and orange food colorings on top. Gently
      mix so there are different colored grains. Sprinkle the raisins over the
      hot rice, cover, and set aside. To prepare the topping, mix the potatoes
      with the orange food coloring in a medium bowl (wear gloves to avoid
      stained fingers!). Heat about 1 inch ( 2 cm) of oil in a large
      heavy-bottomed saucepan. Add the potatoes and cook for 5-6 minutes, then
      transfer to a baking sheet lined with paper towels to drain the excess
      oil. In the same oil, fry the onion slices until browned and crispy, 2-3
      minutes. Add the red peppers cooking for an additional minute. Drain on
      paper towels. To assemble the rice, transfer the pilaf to a large serving
      platter. Top with the fried potatoes, crispy onions, and red bell peppers.
      Enjoy!
